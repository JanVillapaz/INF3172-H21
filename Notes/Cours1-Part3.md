## 1.2 The Network Edge

- They are called end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet.

The Internet end systems include: Desktop computers (desktop PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (Web and e-mail servers), and mobile computers (laptops, smartphones, and tablets).
- End systems are also referred to as *hosts* because they host (run) application programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail client program, or an e-mail server program.

host = end system

Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: **clients** and **servers**

Clients: desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones, and so on.
Servers: More powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream video, relay e-mail, and so on

- Most servers today from which we receive, search results, e-mail, Web pages, and video reside in a large **data centers.**

ex: Google has 30-50 data centers with many having more than one hundred thousand servers

### 1.2.1 Access Networks

- Let's consider the access network, the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as the "edge router") on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.

#### Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite

- Two of the most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **digital subscriber line (DSL)**
